# Control Systems
Submodule of McMaster Exoskeleton Embedded Software, handling feedback control loop.

This repository contains the **general state controller** and **torque controller**.

## Setup

To run this project, you will need:

### 1. Required Software
- **C++ Compiler:** `g++` 
- **Python:** `python3` (for graphing)

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
Before running the analysis, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip3 install matplotlib pandas
```

---

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>/control
```

### 2. Compile & Execute with One Command
```bash
make run_plot
```
This will:
- **Compile the general state controller**
- **Run the FSM**
- **Log joint state and torque data**
- **Generate plots automatically**

### 3. Navigate Through the State Controller
The program starts in the Idle State. Follow these steps:

**Switch to Active State:** 
   - When prompted, enter `1` to activate the controller.
   - This will simulate joint motion and compute torques.

**Exit the Program:**
   - When prompted, enter `3` to stop execution.

## Understanding the Output
After exiting, the system will generate 3 plots:

1. Hip Joint Data (Angle, Velocity, Acceleration, Torque)
2. Knee Joint Data (Angle, Velocity, Acceleration, Torque)
3. Torque Component Breakdown (Mass Ã— Acceleration, Coriolis, Gravity, Total Torque)

As an initial test case, the hip and knee joint angles follow a sinusoidal trajectory.

TODO: Find out what AI model for hip and knee joint angles will be.
